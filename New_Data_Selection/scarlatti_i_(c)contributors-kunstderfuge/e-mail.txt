You are welcome to publish any of my MIDI recordings you wish and, if
you wish, to accompany them any text from any of my web pages. I am
happy with a credit to my home page

I must admit that I dislike the word 'sequences', because mine are
recordings from my playing on a keyboard, whereas 'sequences' are
usually stuck in with a mouse (and sound like it!).
Best wishes
