      <name>Melodic Pitch Variety</name>
      <description>Average number of notes that go by in a MIDI channel before a note's pitch is repeated (including the repeated note itself). This is calculated across each channel individually before being combined. Notes that occur simultaneously on the same MIDI tick are only counted as one note for the purpose of this calculation. Notes that do not recur after 16 notes in the same channel are not included in this calculation. Set to 0 if there are no qualifying repeated notes in the piece.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Mean Rhythmic Value</name>
      <description>The mean rhythmic value of the music, in quarter note units. So, for example, a Mean Rhythmic Value of 0.5 would mean that the duration of an eighth note corresponds to the mean average rhythmic value in the music. This calculation includes both pitched and unpitched notes, is calculated after rhythmic quantization, is not influenced by tempo, and is calculated without regard to the dynamics, voice or instrument of any given note.</description>

      <description>Number of tempo-standardized beat histogram peaks with magnitudes at least 30% as high as the magnitude of the highest peak, and whose bin labels are not integer multiples or factors (using only multipliers of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8, and with an accepted error of +/- 3 bins) of the bin label of the peak with the highest magnitude. This number is then divided by the total number of bins with frequencies over 30% of the highest magnitude.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Note Density Variability</name>
      <description>How much the note density (average number of notes per second) varies throughout the piece.  Takes into account all notes in all voices, including both pitched and unpitched notes. In order to calculate this, the piece is broken into windows of 5 second duration, and the note density of each window is calculated. The final value of this feature is then found by calculating the standard deviation of the note densities of these windows. Set to 0 if there is insufficient music for more than one window.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Parallel Motion</name>
      <description>Fraction of movements between voices that consist of parallel motion (the fraction is calculated relative to the total amount of qualifying transitions, including all parallel, similar, contrary and oblique transitions). If more than two voices are involved in a given pitch transition, then each possible pair of voices comprising the transition is included in the calculation. Note that only transitions from one set of pitches to another set of pitches comprising the same number of pitches as the first are included in this calculation, although a brief lookahead is performed in order to accommodate small rhythmic desynchronizations (e.g. if a MIDI file is a transcription of a human performance). Only unique pitches are included in this calculation (unisons are treated as a single pitch). All pitches present are considered, regardless of their MIDI channel or track; this has the advantage of accommodating polyphonic instruments such as piano or guitar, but the consequence is that this feature does not incorporate an awareness of voice crossing.</description>
